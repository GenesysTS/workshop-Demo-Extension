### How to use Export / Import
The extension Options / Demo shows a summary of all defined HotSpots.These are organized by domain, then by page within each domain.
To save a demo for a domain to your disk, select the 'Export' button next to the desired domain. This will download a JSON file to your computer.

To share this demo with someone, or to restore your demo on a different machine or Chrome profile, go to the extension Options / Demo and click 'Import'. Choose the previously exported JSON file and 'Load'. This will load this demo (overwrites the entire domain demo if any). Simply hit 'Save' to apply these changes.
